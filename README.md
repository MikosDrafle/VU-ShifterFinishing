# Verillia's Utility Kit: `VerUtils`
Contains a load of interesting mechanics (soon) that can be of use to anybody.

Sister mod of Verillia's Style Set (unreleased)

## Entities:
Various entities the mod uses.
### RailBooster
ID: `Verillia/Utils/Railbooster/Node` and `Verillia/Utils/Railbooster/Rail`

Namespace: `Celeste.Mod.Verillia.Utils.Entities`

Class: `RailBooster` and `RailRope`

Madeline enters through one of the entry nodes and zips around in a network of rails, changing direction in forks.
If she were to launch in any of the cardinal directions, she gains a "small" boost to launch her further.
Rails may or may not give the player invincibility on travel.

Bugs(/Features):
- Slowrailing

  If Madeline were to dash diagonally, barely hitting a corner on the way to an entry node. Then she will begin to traverse the first rail slowly and in a jagged manner. Due to how absolutely perfect this has to be executed, it will be a tech until an insane amount of mappers complain and it has not been officialized as one. (Partially due to me not wanting to figure out what is causing this issue.)
